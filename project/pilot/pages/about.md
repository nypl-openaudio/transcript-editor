# About This Project  

Today thousands of libraries and public media organizations publish large digital audio collections online. Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, leaving them invisible to search engines and inaccessible to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but the transcripts they produce are still error-prone and require careful human editing to reach full accuracy. Transcripts are important because they make audio content searchable online, and accessible to people with hearing disabilities.  

If you're reading this, you are among those facing and trying to solve this challenge. Thanks for participating with us in experimenting with a solution!


# Schedule and Transcripts  

NYPL is committed to hosting this sandbox instance through July 2016. At the end of the trial period, we will return to you the computer-generated transcripts and corrected transcripts of your audio. The number of corrected transcripts depends on the time spent editing your audio.
